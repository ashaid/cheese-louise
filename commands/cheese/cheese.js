      "Historical verbose description of Bleu d'Auvergne cheese\n\nA distinctive, semi-firm cowâ€™s milk blue cheese, Bleu d'Auvergne has been manufactured in the Auvergne region of France since the early 19th century. It presents a strong aroma, a pronounced taste and an intense colour. The cheese has a greyish, slightly oily and rather elastic consistency and it is usually formed into a wedge shape.\n\nThe process of manufacturing Bleu d'Auvergne begins with the milk being heated to 30Â°C. The milk is then inoculated with salt and special moulds whichgives the cheese its distinctive blue veins. After that, the cheese is brought to pressures of up to 200 kg/cmÂ², ensuring a solid but creamy cheese. \n\nThe final step involves warming up the cheese and turning it daily for 2 to 4 weeks, depending on its weight. During this period, the special moulds and salt will continue to penetrate, allowing the blue veins to form and creating the characteristic crumbly-chalky texture that is associated with the cheese. \n\nOnce the cheese is ready for consumption, it should be stored in a cool place. When served, Bleu d'Auvergne cheese should be cut in wedges and served with nuts, a salad of bitter leaves, fresh fruits or a sweet and tart chutney.";
